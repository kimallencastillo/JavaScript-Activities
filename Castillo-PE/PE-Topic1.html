    <ul>
        <li>Central Processing Unit  ( CPU ) -  known as the brain behind every computer system. It performs  storage, processing, and control functions.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">Parts of CPU</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><b>Logic Unit  (ALU ) </b>  - part of CPU that performs mathematical and logical operations.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><b>	Control Unit </b>– part of  CPU  that serves as the supervisor of the entire computer system. Overall in-charged of coordinating the activities of all the subsystems that comprise the computer system.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><b>	Memory</b>  - part of CPU that stores the actual data and instructions. Also called primary memory. Primary memory  is a type memory that is directly available to CPU. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <b>Types of Primary memory :</b>
            </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Random Access Memory ( RAM )  -  a type of primary memory which  is volatile in nature ( less permanent ).  It automatically  looses its contents when the  computer is turned off.

        </li>
        <li>Read-only Memory ( ROM) -  a type of memory that contains predefined programs being used by the computer for its operation. It is more permanent compared to RAM. Users are allowed to access the contents of ROM but are restricted from making any modifications.

        </li>
        <li>Input devices – devices that transform data, from human-readable form to machine-readable form.<br>

    <h3 id="t4">Different Types of Computer</h3>
    <p>Computers  can be classified based on their size or  capabilities,  their  principles  of operation,  their purpose , and their age.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; "><b>A.	Types of Computer Based on  Purpose</b></li>
        
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Special purpose computers  are built for specific application. 
            Example:  ATM machines,  Point-of-Sales Terminals,  Toll-Fee Collecting Machines
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">	General purpose computers are used for any type of applications. They can store different programs and do the jobs as per the instructions specified on those programs. Most of the computers that we see today, are general purpose computers.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; " id="t5"><b>  B.	Types of Computer Based on Principles of  Operation</b></li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">1.	Analog Computer is a computing device that works on continuous range of values. The results given by the analog computers will only be approximate since they deal with quantities that vary continuously. It generally deals with physical variables such as voltage, pressure, temperature, speed, etc.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">2.	Digital computer operates on digital data such as numbers. It uses binary number system in which there are only two digits 0 and 1. Each one is called a bit. Digital computers are designed using digital circuits in which there are two levels for an input or output signal. These two levels are known as logic 0 and logic 1. Digital Computers can give more accurate and faster results.
            Digital computer is well suited for solving complex problems in engineering and technology. Hence digital computers have an increasing use in the field of design, research and data processing.
            </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">3.	Hybrid computer combines the desirable features of analog and digital computers. It is mostly used for automatic operations of complicated physical processes and machines. Now-a-days analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are used for transforming the data into suitable form for either type of computation.
            Example: In hospital’s ICU, analog devices might measure the patients temperature, blood pressure and other vital signs. These measurements which are in analog might then be converted into numbers and supplied to digital components in the system. These components are used to monitor the patient’s vital sign and send signals if any abnormal readings are detected. Hybrid computers are mainly used for specialized tasks.

        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory</li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Enormous, taking up entire rooms. </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, generated a lot of heat, which was often   the cause of malfunctions.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Output was displayed on printouts.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	The  UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. 
            The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p><b>Second Generation (1956-1963)</b></p>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	Transistors replaced vacuum tubes.  
            The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors. Though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube. 
            </li>

        <p><b>Fourth Generation (1971-Present) </b></p>
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the computer—from the central processing unit and memory to input/output controls—on a single chip.
            </li> 
        <li style="list-style-type:none; ">•	In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user</li>
